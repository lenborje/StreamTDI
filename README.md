# StreamTDI #
This is an implementation of the prime number enumerator TDI, which uses [Wheel factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization) to check for primality.

The main purpose of TDI is to provide an algorithm that can easily be implemented using various techniques, languages, platforms, etc,
just to give an indication of how well the chosen target supports looping, integer arithmetic, and also how well various languages
support common programming idioms.

And of course it's mostly for fun.
